      "him to cover long distances.\n",

      " In his first attempts, then, to send wireless messages, young Marconi\n",
      "had done four things and these were (1) to see the possibilities of\n",
      "using electric waves set up by a Hertz apparatus for sending messages;\n",
      "(2) to put a telegraph key in the sending circuit; (3) to use a Popoff\n",
      "receiver for receiving the electric waves, and (4) to put a Morse\n",
      "register in the receiving circuit. The next thing to know is that light waves and wireless waves are\n",
      "exactly the same kind of waves, that is, both are caused by electric\n",
      "stresses and magnetic whirls in the ether, but while light waves are in\n",
      "the neighborhood of the ten-millionth of an inch in length, wireless\n",
      "waves are so long they make no impression at all on the eye.\n",
      "\n",
      " But when Marconi showed the world how to send messages across the ocean,\n",
      "and since one of the chief factors for long distance wireless\n",
      "transmission was a high aerial, it didn’t take half-an-eye for the\n",
      "_French War Department_ to see that the Eiffel Tower, which was very\n",
      "nearly a thousand feet high, was just the thing to support an aerial.\n",

      " Rockets were fired in lieu of regular fireworks and Mackey,\n",
      "having the most powerful set, sent a message to old _Boreas_ and old\n",
      "_Arcticus_ who are pioneers in the refrigerating business, and if the\n",
      "_North Pole_ has an aerial suspended from it and the latter has a\n",
      "receiver attached to it, I doubt not but that they listened-in to the\n",
      "first wireless signals ever sent within the polar circle; if so, they\n",
      "heard some mighty fine things said about themselves and the glorious,\n",
      "though, withal frigid, country they rule over.\n",
      "\n",
      " Now I don’t know whether you know anything about wireless, but I will\n",
      "say here that while you can only send over short distances with a good\n",
      "sized sending apparatus, you can receive over quite long distances with\n",
      "a cheap receiver if you have a fairly decent aerial, by which I mean one\n",
      "that is high enough above the ground and has a long enough stretch, and,\n",
      "of course, it must be properly insulated. The up-to-date feature of this set was the storage battery which\n",
      "provided an auxiliary source of current so that in the event of the ship\n",
      "becoming disabled and water flooding the engine room, which would put\n",
      "the dynamo out of commission, the storage battery in the operating room\n",
      "could be thrown in and _C Q D_ could be sent out as long as the wireless\n",
      "room remained above water. In that year Heinrich Hertz, a young German college professor,\n",
      "discovered that when an electric spark was made by any kind of an\n",
      "apparatus the positive and negative electric charges in uniting together\n",
      "would not only break down the air to make the spark, but would form an\n",
      "_oscillating current_, that is, a current which surges to and fro\n",
      "hundreds of thousands of times a second, and that this _high frequency\n",
      "current_, as it is called, sets up waves in the ether just as the\n",

      "he showed an aerial and ground connected to his sending and receiving\n",
      "apparatus (see the diagram) but even at this time he did not understand\n",
      "the importance of a high, well insulated aerial and a good ground.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "To get the best results the aerials of two stations communicating with\n",
      "each other should both be vertical or flat-top, that is, a vertical wire\n",
      "will not receive from a flat-top nearly as well as from another one that\n",
      "is vertical and this is just as true the other way about. Quite a number of people seem to be imbued with the idea that no one\n",
      "ever thought of sending messages by wireless before Mr. Marconi--in fact\n",
      "that he just put together a few old electrical instruments and forthwith\n",
      "sent and received messages over space without any connecting wires.\n",
      "\n",
      " Not to be out-generaled I thought I’d try one more scheme and that was\n",
      "to use a couple of pieces of wire five or six feet long for the aerial\n",
      "and ground, hook them on to the detector of my receiver, fix the free\n",
      "end of the aerial over the window and lay the free end of the ground\n",
      "wire on the floor. In those\n",
      "good old days when amateur wireless was young any fellow could set up\n",
      "his own station, use whatever _wavelength_ he wanted to send with, and\n",
      "blab any news that chanced to come his way; but all this was changed a\n",
      "few years later when the government found that too many amateurs were\n",
